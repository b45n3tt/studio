Driving home on an overcast afternoon.
<!--more-->


1. I named the dog Jupiter.
2. The thought of the kerosene heater that spilled in the back of the Astro Van I inherited in my youth. The fragrance stayed with her for a long time. The seats came out fairly easy and sat in the garage for a year or two.

 A blue van with a white pin stripe. That was the flavor I remember driving around for a few years in the early 2000's. Chevy made the Astro, GMC made the Safari. Chevy was cooler. I don't know why you just seemed to see more of them. Now they are rare. If you see one, like anything rare, there is an implied story that goes with it. If you have a picture of an Astro or Safari send it my way.
